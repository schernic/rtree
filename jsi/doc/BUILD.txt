To build the JSI library from source, install maven 3 and run the following:

% cd <location-of-pom.xml>
% mvn package

This will generate the binary package (jsi-x.y.z.jar) in the target subdirectory.

The following is a list of useful maven targets:
  o eclipse:eclipse (generate eclipse project files; see below)
  o clean 
  o compile
  o test
  o -Dtest=ReferenceCompareTest_10000 test
  o package	
  o site
  o assembly:single (create package only)
  o site:deploy
  o deploy
  
To import the project into eclipse, run mvn eclipse:eclipse, and then set the M2_REPO variable
in Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables to point to your local
maven repository (e.g. ~/.m2/repository)
