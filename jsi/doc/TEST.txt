These are the steps needed to check that the JSI library is working correctly. 
Note this will take a very long time to run:

% cd <location-of-pom.xml>
% mvn test [This runs a short and quick test]
% mvn -Dtest=ReferenceCompareTest_1000 test [Long test]
% mvn -Dtest=ReferenceCompareTest_10000 test [Very long test]
% mvn -Dtest=ReferenceCompareTest_100000 test [Ridiculously long test]

If any errors occur, please raise an issue at https://github.com/aled/jsi/issues
